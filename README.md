# predicting-car-prices
This is the guided project of ["Machine Learning Fundamentals"](https://app.dataquest.io/course/machine-learning-fundamentals) at Dataquest.

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a simple machine learning algorithm and it is perfect for experiencing a machine learning workflow because of its simplicity.

The goal of this project is to experience the workflow of building the machine learning model using the k-NN method and predict car market prices.
